# Joke

This is a command that builds an interface to get jokes printed to the terminal.
Currently implemented are random (default), -n specific and -a all.

Laughs NOT guaranteeed (the jokes are more to test the concepts so far)

Link manpage to usr/local/share/man to make it available for the user using `man joke`.

# Connect

This is a generalized version of "Connect 4". It defaults to a Connect 4 (7 x 6) but alternatively takes 3 command line inputs [c0, c1, c2] to overwrite this to Connect c0 (c1 x c2).
