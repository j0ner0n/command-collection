# Joke

Your daily dosage of jokes, right in the terminal.
Currently implemented are default (random joke), flag -n (show specific joke) and flag -a (show all jokes).

Link manpage to usr/local/share/man to make it available for the user using `man joke`.

# Connect

This is a generalized version of the game "Connect 4" inside the Terminal. It defaults to a Connect 4 (7 wide x 6 high) but alternatively takes 3 command line inputs [c0, c1, c2] to overwrite this to Connect c0 (c1 wide x c2 high).

# Brew-revise

A python script to help you clean up your brew formulae you don't use without breaking dependencies. A short description appears that tells you how to use it so just run it and you are good to go!
